      <p> In this the game, you learn properties about the elements as well as reactions that can occur between them.
        If you pay attention to detail, you will notice the colors of the elements are not random, they are colored based on which
        group they belong to: Alkali metals, alkaline metals, transition metals, non metals, halogens, noble gases, actinides and lanthanides.
      <hr>
      <p>The goal of the game is to find the matching elements, but beware, chemical reactions may occur when you click two different elements!</p>
      <p>You lose life if you create the hydrochloric acid, HCl</p>
